Compilation and Installation of the ePro Firmware
-------------------------------------------------

The ePro firmware uses a CMake project file for compilation and installation. It is
intended for use on Linux/Unix and assumes an Atmel AVR ISP mkII as programmer.

The following software components are required:
* CMake >=3.5
* GNU Make
* GNU AVR Toolchain (avr-binutils, avr-gcc, avr-libc)
* Python 3.x
* AVRDUDE

Run 'mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../AVRToolchain.cmake ..'
to generate a Makefile, then run 'make' to compile the firmware.

When programming a device for the first time, the correct fuse bits need to be set by
running 'make fuses'.

To upload the compiled program to the ePro device, simply run 'make program'.

Access to the programmer usually requires root permissions. In order to be able to program
the device as a normal user, we can define a custom udev rule. To do so, create a new rule
file (e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/10-avrdude.rules) with the following content:

# Atmel AVR ISP mkII
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="2104", GROUP="users", MODE="0660"

To apply the new rule immediately, run 'udevadm control --reload', then reconnect the programmer.
